/**
 * A working copy whose readers cannot be proven stopped is quarantined instead
 * of deleted. Quarantine is deliberately one-way for the life of the session:
 * the only thing that could lift it is proof that the native tree died, and the
 * absence of that proof is exactly what put the path here. The bytes stay on
 * disk, no further close attempt deletes them, and the stale working-copy sweep
 * reclaims them on a later run once no process from this session can hold them.
 *
 * Retaining a temp directory costs disk. Deleting one a Poppler child is still
 * reading costs the user's document, so the trade is not close.
