/**
 * Termination is a request until something proves the target is gone. A process
 * group that outlives its kill, a `taskkill` that reports failure, and a
 * termination watchdog that fires before the tree is confirmed dead all leave
 * native readers holding the files the caller was about to reclaim.
 *
 * The layers that ask for termination cannot decide what to do about that; the
 * layer that owns the bytes can. So the outcome travels on the error the
 * termination produced, from the native adapter that observed it up to the
 * working-copy owner that would otherwise delete a directory a live child is
 * still reading.
